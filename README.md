# Python Onebank (Bank Management System)

## Installation

Created using customtkinter and tkinter library 

Open the project only in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

after downloading the project first, update your database password and username in database.py file

create a database named 'bank' in MySQL and throw command :

```cmd
create database bank;
use bank;
```

first, run the database.py file alone then run the remaining project 

first sign up using a new account by running the signup.py file

login in the same account you created using signin.py


## Some Bugs

1. In the signin.py file you need to rerun because it is only accepting queries when run second time (it dosent do any operations even the password is correct for the first time)
2. Some UI bugs
